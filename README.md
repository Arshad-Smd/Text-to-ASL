# Text-to-ASL

**Problem Statement**
In today's digital world, effective communication is essential for everyone, yet individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing often face barriers due to the lack of widespread accessibility solutions. American Sign Language (ASL) serves as a crucial bridge for the deaf community, but many platforms and tools are not optimized to support seamless ASL communication. This creates a communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals in various scenarios, from daily conversations to online meetings and educational settings.

The ASL project aims to address this gap by developing an intuitive, real-time American Sign Language translation application. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Unity for sign language interpretation, this project translates spoken or written text into ASL, helping break down communication barriers and enabling more inclusive interactions across platforms.
